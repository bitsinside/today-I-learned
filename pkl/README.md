# Pkl, a programming language for producing configuration

## 1. Introduction

- Pkl (pronnounced _Pickle_) â€‰is a configuration-as-code language with rich validation and tooling. It can be used as a command line tool, software library, or build plugin. Pkl scales from small to large, simple to complex, ad-hoc to recurring configuration tasks.
- A special purpose configuration language; a blend between a static configuration format, and a general-purpose programming language.
- Use cases:
  - Generating static configuration (JSON, YAML, and XML property lists)
  - Application runtime configuration: At the time of writing, Pkl offers configuration libraries for the JVM runtime, Swift, and also for Golang.
