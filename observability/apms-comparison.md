## Datadog

<https://blog.underdog.io/inside-datadogs-tech-stack/>

- Use agent, collects events and metrics from hosts and sents them to Datadog. The Datadog agent is open-source.
- More than 200 built-in integrations. Allow to write a custom integrations.
- [Service Map](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/service-map/)
- Auto-discovery: Docker labels & Kubernetes only.

## Dynatrace

- OneAgent: essentially a set of specialized processes that run on each monitored host. OneAgent collects metrics from the operating system it runs on compares the metrics to baseline performance metrics. **Install just one agent, one time forever - zero manual configuration**. -> pros + cons?
- Dynatrace [auto-discovers](https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/application-topology-discovery/) all the components and dependencies of your entire technology stack end-to-end.
  - Dynatrace detects billions of causal dependencies between websites, applications, services, processes, hosts, networks, and cloud infrastructure with minutes.
- Dynatrace AI engine can identify anomalies and performance issues the cause of the problem. This is all done automatically and you don't need to configure anything.
- Extend Dynatrace: Dynatrace offers a number approaches that you can use to extend Dynatrace out-of-the-box monitoring to address your environment's specific monitoring needs.
  - OneAgent Plugins: [How do I create a Python custom plugin](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/oneagent-plugins/how-do-i-create-a-python-custom-plugin/)
  - Dynatrace API
  - OneAgent SDK
  - ActiveGate Plugins
  - JMX plugins

## AppDynamics

- AppDynamics still Flash in parts of the UI, it sucks

## Hawkular

- Hawkular is a set of Open Source projects designed to be a generic solution for common monitoring problems. Hawkular projects provide REST services that can be used for all kinds of monitoring needs.
- The monitoring services provided by Hawkular have been adopted by different projects and are central to the Middleware management solution in ManageIQ project.
