# [Cloud infrastructure monitoring checklist](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/cloud-infrastructure-monitoring-checklist-everything-need/)

A few questions to consider

## How easy is the solution to implement, configure and maintain?

With increasingly complex environments of today's applications, ease of implementation and ease of use become more than just nice-to-haves - they are esstential.

- auto-discovery for your cloud environment.
- auto-baselining.
- automatic root cause analysis.

## Does it provide real-time insights into the health of your cloud resources?

- Give you real-time picture of health of your entire cloud-based architecture.
- Choose a cloud monitoring solution that has been built from the ground up with the dynamic environments in mind. They can eliminate all blind spots and can keep up with any changes of the dynamic environments.

## Does it provide full stack application performance monitoring, or only firefighting capabilities at infrastructure level?

- To get a full stack view of all your applications, you will need the ability to monitor from different perspectives:
- Digital Experience Analytics
- Application Performance Management
- Cloud and Infrastructure Monitoring

## How fast it lets you find the root cause of an issue?

- Using a tool that gives you causation instead of correlation.
- If a monitoring tool can capture every transaction all the time and uses a tagging approach across every remoting call, it gives the performance engineer causation based data, which gives them confidence and hard facts on what is causing system problems.

## How does the solution handle performance baselining for ultra-dynamic environments?

- Setting up performance baselines is another tricky part in cloud infrastructure monitoring. It can involve a lot of time-consuming and potentially error-prone manual effort with traditional APM-especially because most of them rely on averages and transaction samples to determine normal performance.
- Effectively baseline -> A tool that uses percentiles based on 100% gap-free data.

## Does it offer built-in log monitoring, or needs additional tool?

- Being able to monitor application performance and analyze related process log files using the same tool helps their DevOps, Development, and QA teams to perform their jobs quickly and efficientlybenelli 302s.

## Will the monitoring solution scale with your business needs?

- Modern cloud environments run thousands of nodes with hunderds of technologies, distributed across datacenters around the globe.
  - How far will this scale?
  - How long until I'll need a newer, faster, biggesr one?
- Picking a monitoring solution that gives you real-time insights into your cloud components is important, but ensuring that it will not crash and burn as you expand your environment is crucial.
