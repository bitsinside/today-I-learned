## 1. Deleting Unneeded Indices

- List all indices wih [cat indices API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/cat-indices.html), find your unneeded indices.
- Delete them with [Delete index API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-delete-index.html).

## 2. Use a different sharding scheme

- Itâ€™s possible that for some reason one or more indices were created with far more shards than necessary.
- A check of `/_cat/indices`:

```
health status index                                            pri rep     docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   scaling-2020.05.17        qyNXa5HBSs-F9ic5gMwl0Q 5   2       424        0            470.1kb    235kb
green  open   tomcat-2020.05.24         IS1w3pRjQ6mZLMPQLhNnIQ 5   2       1138       0            2.4mb      1.2mb
# 5 primary shards 2 replicas
```

- The number of primary shards can not be changed once an index has been created. To fix this, you will need to manually [create a new index with the desired shard scheme](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-create-index.html) and [reindex](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/docs-reindex.html) the data.
- Quickly apply to new indices with [template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-templates.html).

## Reduce replication

- For most use-cases, _a single replica is perfectly sufficient for redundancy and load capacity_.
- Reducing the replica count for the index is allowed, check the [Update settings API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/indices-update-settings.html),
- `Replication = Avalability + redundancy`, you **can** set all replicas to 0 so as to fit as many indices into your cluster as possible. This means that your primary data has no live backup. If a node in your cluster goes offline, data loss is basically guaranteed. So always keep replicas >= 1.

## Data collocation

- Reducing usage using alias and custom routing rules to collocate different data models onto the same group of shards.
- Data collocation: Many Elasticsearch clients use an index per model paradigm as the default for data organization.
