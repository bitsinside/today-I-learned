## Introduction

- Dependency hell: the bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this put of despair.

  - Dependency specifications are too tight -> version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package).
  - Dependency specifications are too loosely -> version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable).

- Solution: A simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented -> Sematic Versioning (SemVer).

## Sematic Versioning (SemVer)

### Version Format

![](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/semver.png)

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes.
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

### Rules

1. Softaware using SemVer _MUST_ declare a public API.

2. A normal version number _MUST_ take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y and Z are non-negative integers, and _MUST NOT_ contain leading zeroes. Each element _MUST_ increase numerically.

3. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version _MUST NOT_ be modified. Any modifications _MUST_ be released as a new version.

4. Major version (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

5. Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes.

6. Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) _MUST_ be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

7. Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) _MUST_ be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It _MUST_ be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It _MAY_ be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It _MAY_ include patch level changes. Patch version _MUST_ be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.

8. Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) _MUST_ be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It _MAY_ include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version _MUST_ be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.

9. A pre-release version _MAY_ be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers _MUST_ comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers _MUST NOT_ be empty. Numeric identifiers _MUST NOT_ include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92.

10. Build metadata _MAY_ be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers _MUST_ comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers _MUST NOT_ be empty. Build metadata _SHOULD_ be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85.

11. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered. Precedence _MUST_ be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0. Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version _MUST_ be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows: identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically and identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.
