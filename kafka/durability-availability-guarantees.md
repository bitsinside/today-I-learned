# Data Durability and Availability Guarantees

Source: <https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/architecture/guarantees/>

- Consumers only see committed records. Producers on the other hand have some choices as to when receive acknowledment for the success or failure of a produce request from the broker.
- Producer acks = 0.
  - The producer doesn't wait for a response from the broker.
  - No strong durability guarantee.

- Producer acks = 1.
  - Better durability (data was written to the leader replica), a little higher latency.

- Producer acks = all (-1).
  - Default.
  - Highest level of durability, higher latency.

- Topic `min.insync.replicas`.
  - The broker doesn't allow an event to be written to a topic unless there are N replicas in the ISR.
  - `min.insync.replicas = 2` and replication factor is 3 -> 2 nodes down, an exception!

- Producer idempotence.
  - Kafka also has ordering guarantees which are handled mainly by Kafkaâ€™s partitioning and the fact that partitions are append-only immutable logs.
  - Events are written to a particular partition in the order they were sent, and consumers read those events in the same order (unless failure happens -> duplicate events).
  - Default: `event.idempotence = true`.

- End-to-end ordering guarantee.
  - `acks=all` + `event.idempotence=true`
