Zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, one-shot learning are all techniques that allow a machine learning model to make predictions for new classes with limited labeled data.

- One-shot learning: each new class has one labeled example. The goal is to make predictions for the new classes based on this single example.
- Few-shot learning: there is a limited number of labeled examples for each new class. The goal is to make predictions for new classes based on just a few examples of labeled data.
- Zero-shot learning: there is absolutely no labeled data available for new classes. The goal is for the algorithm to make predictions about new classes by using prior knowledge about the relationships that exist between classes it already knows. In the case of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, for example, prior knowledge is likely include sematic similarities.
