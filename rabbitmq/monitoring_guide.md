## 1. Infrastructure and kernel metrics

- CPU stats (user, system, iowait & idle percentages)
- Memory usage (used, buffered, cached & free percentages)
- Virtual memory (dirty page flushes, writeback volume)
- Disk I/O (operation & amount of data transfered per unit time, time to service operations)
- Free disk space on the mount used for the node data directory
- File descriptors and [max_system_limit](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html#open-file-handle-limit)
- TCP connections by state (`EASTABLISHED`, `CLOSE_WAIT`, `TIME_WAIT`)
- Network throughput (bytes received, bytes sent) & maximum network throughput
- Network latency (between all RabbitMQ nodes in a cluster as well as to/from clients)

## 2. RabbitMQ metrics

### 2.1. Cluster-wide metrics

- Cluster-wide metrics provide a high level view of cluster state.

### 2.2. Node metrics

- There are 2 HTTP API endpoints that provide access to node-specific metrics:
  - GET /api/nodes/{node} returns stats for a single node
  - GET /api/nodes returns stats for all cluster members: return an array of objects -> prefer -> reduces the number of requests.

| Metric                                                                                        | JSON field name                   |

### 2.3. Individual queue metrics

- Individual queue metrics are made available through the [HTTP API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#http-api) via the GET /api/queues/{vhost}/{qname} endpoint.

| Metric                                                                      | JSON field name                                                                                                                     |

### 2.4. Application-level metrics

- What metrics applications track can be system-specific but some are relevant to most systems:
  - Connection opening rate
  - Channel opening rate
  - Connection failure (recovery) rate
  - Publishing rate
  - Delivery rate
  - Positive delivery acknowledgement rate
  - Negative delivery acknowledgement rate
  - Mean/95th percentile delivery processing latency

## 3. Some notes

- The recommended metric collection interval is 15 second. For production systems a collection interval of 30 or even 60 seconds is recommended. [Prometheus](https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html) exporter API is designed to be scraped every 15 seconds, including production systems.
- In a clustered environment every node can serve metric endpoint requests. Cluster-wide metrics can be fetched from any node that [can contact its peers](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#clustering). That node will collect and combine data from its peers as needed before producing a response.
- Every node also can serve requests to endpoints that provide [node-specific metrics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#node-metrics) for itself as well as other cluster nodes. Like with [infrastructure and OS metrics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#system-metrics), node-specific metrics must be collected for each node. Monitoring tools can execute HTTP API requests against any node.
- As mentioned earlier, inter-node connectivity issues will [affect HTTP API behaviour](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html#clustering). Choose a random online node for monitoring requests. For example, using a load balancer or [round-robin DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS).
