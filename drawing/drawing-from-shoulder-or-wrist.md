Pros

- You're extremely precise—you control the tool fully.
- You can easily draw the tiniest details.
- You can draw a whole picture on a small area.
- The result, if done properly, looks deliberate and clean.

Cons

- Your tool must stay sharp all the time.
- You control every little part of a line, so it's hard to draw it long and straight in one go.
- Every line is important, so if you don't know what you're drawing you'll probably end up with an "overlapping mess".
- You can't work on a bigger workspace.
- If you start a picture this way, it will likely look planned and lifeless.
- If you try to work faster and press harder, it's very easy to strain your wrist. With time it may even result in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!

When to Use It?

- When you want to add details to a picture.
- When you want to fix something.
- When you have a small workspace.
- When you know exactly what you want to draw and you need precision for it.

Pros

- Your lines are expressive and full of style.
- You can work quickly and loosely.
- You don't need to focus on details—the picture looks quite finished with a few lines.
- Your whole arm stays relaxed, so there's a lower risk of straining the wrist.
- You can draw long, straight lines and circles.
- You can use almost every tool for it, brush included.

Cons

- You can't fully control the lines.
- You can't draw details this way.
- You need to do it fast.
- A big workspace is required.
- The result looks more or less "sketchy".

When to Use It?

- When you want to start a picture without a precise idea.
- When you want to study, especially anatomy, poses, or shading.
- When you want to try a series of versions of one picture before going into details.
