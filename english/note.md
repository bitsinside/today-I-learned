# Just a note

1. The article "a" is used before a singular noun that is unspecified or not previously mentioned, while the article "the" is used before a singular or plural noun that is specific or previously mentioned. For example, "I saw a dog in the park" refers to any dog in general, while "I saw the dog that chased me yesterday" refers to a specific dog that was mentioned before.
2. "Can" is used to express ability or possibility in the present, while "could" is used to express ability or possibility in the past or as a polite request. For example, "I can speak French" refers to the present ability to speak French, while "I could speak French when I was younger" refers to the past ability to speak French. "Could you please pass me the salt?" is a polite request using "could".
