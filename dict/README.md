This is the first time I heard about Dictionary Server Protocol. They exist to allow you to query dictionaries over a network.

```text
For many years, the Internet community has relied on the "webster" protocol for access to natural language definitions. [â€¦] In recent years, the number of publicly available webster servers on the Internet has dramatically decreased. Fortunately, several freely-distributable dictionaries and lexicons have recently become available on the Internet. However, these freely-distributable databases are not accessible via a uniform interface, and are not accessible from a single site.
```

[The (informal) standard was published in 1997](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2229) but has kept a relatively low profile since then. You can understand why it was invented - in an age of low-size disk drives and expensive software, looking up data over a dedicated protocol seems like a nifty2 idea.

Then disk size exploded, databases became cheap, and search engines made it easy to look up words.

Run this command:

```shell
# Default database
curl dict://dict.org/d:Internet
# If you want to switch database
curl dict://dict.org/d:Internet:jargon
```

Perhaps the easiest way to explore the protocol and server is to use telnet:

```shell
telnet dict.org dict

The following commands are unofficial server extensions for debugging
only.  You may find them useful if you are using telnet as a client.
If you are writing a client, you MUST NOT use these commands, since
they won't be supported on any other server!

D word                       -- DEFINE * word
D database word              -- DEFINE database word
M word                       -- MATCH * . word
M strategy word              -- MATCH * strategy word
M database strategy word     -- MATCH database strategy word
S                            -- STATUS
H                            -- HELP
Q                            -- QUIT
.

```

Cool!
