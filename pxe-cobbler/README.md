# OS provisioning

## Problem

- Deploying new VMs is a paintfully heavy and error-prone process.
- Solution: A tool able to automate this the best way possible.

## PXE - Preboot Exectution Environment

### What is PXE?

- A short and simple explanation of PXE is that it allows you to boot a computer over a network without requiring a harddrive or cdrom. You can do this with as few as 2 computers (1 server, 1 client) or you can do it with as many as can get your hands on.
- PXE uses the protocols IP, TFTP and DHCP with PXE-specific extensions.

### PXE architecture

- PXE runs on the BIOS of the NIC.
- PXE provides APIs to a boostrap program for accessing the protocols involved in PXE operation.

    - Preboot Services API: Contains several control and information functions.
    - Trivial File Transport Protocol (TFTP) API: Enables opening and closing of TFTP connections, and reading packets from and writing packets to a TFTP connection.
    - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) API: Enables opening and closing UDP connections, and reading packets from and writing packets to a UDP connection.
    - Universal Network Driver Interface (UNDI) API: Enables basic control of and I/O through the client's network interface device.

### PXE Protocol

- How it works? PXE message flow:

![PXE Boot](./imgs/PXE_Boot.png)

- Step 1: The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message to the standard DHCP port (^&).
- Step 2: The DHCP or Proxy DHCP Service responds by sending a DHCPOFFER message to the client on the standard DHCP reply port (68).
- Step 3: From the DHCPOFFER(s) that it receives, the client records the following:
  - The Client IP address.
  - The Boot Server list from the Boot Server field in the PXE tags from the DHCPOFFER.
- Step 4: If the client selects an IP address offered by a DHCP Service, then it must complete the standard DHCP protocol by sending a request for the address back to the Service and then waiting for an acknowledgement from the Service.
- Step 5: The client send a DHCPREQUEST with the same information as step 1 to the selected boot server, either on broadcast UDP (67) or multicast/unicast (4011).
- Step 6: The Boot Server unicasts a DHCPACk packet back to the client on the client source port. This reply packet contains:
  - Boot file name
  - Multicast TFTP configuration parameters.
  - Any other options the NBP requires before it can be successfully executed.
- Step 7: The client downloads the executable file using either standard TFTP (69) or MTFTP.
- Step 8: The PXE client determines whether an authenticity test on the downloaded file is required. If the test is required, the client sends another DHCPREQUEST message to the boot server requesting a credentials file for the prev downloaded boot file, downloads the credentials via TFTP or MTFTP and performs the authenticity test.
- Step 9: If the authenticity test succeeded or was not required, then the PXE client initiates exection of the downloaded code.

### Problem with PXE

- PXE boot needs a tight and coherent integration of all these services: DHCP, TFTP,...
  - Installing and setting them requires specfic experience, skills and time.
  - Time + skills = investment (either from people or from the wallet)
  - More details:
    - Configure services such as DHCP, TFTP, DNS,...
    - Fill individual client machine entries in DHCP and TFTP configurion files.
    - Create automatic deployment files (such as kickstart).
    - Extract installation media to HTTP/TFTP/NFS repositories.

## Cobbler

### In the nutshell

```
Cobbler is a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments. It glues together and automates many associated Linux tasks so you do not have to hop between many various commands and applications when deploying new systems, and, in some cases, changing existing ones. Cobbler can help with provisioning, managing DNS and DHCP, package updates, power management, configuration management orchestration, and much more.

### How does Cobbler address PXE problems?

- Create a central point of management for all aspects of machine provisioning.
- It can configure services, create repositories, extract operating system media, integrate with a configurion management system.
- Cobbler creates a layer of abstraction where you can run commands like "add new repository" or "change client machine operating system."

### What the tool offers?

With Cobbler, you can install machines without manual intervention. Cobbler sets up a PXE boot environment and controls all aspects that are related to installation, such as network boot services (DHCP and TFTP) and repository mirroring. When you want to install a new machine, Cobbler:

- Uses a prev defined template to configure the DHCP service (if manage DHCP enabled)
- Mirrors a repositor or extracts a media to register a new operating system.
- Creates an entry in the DHCP configuration file for the machine to be installed with the parameters that you specify (IP and MAC address).
- Creates the appropriate PXE files under the TFTP service directory.
- Restarts the DHCP serice to reflect the changes.
- Restarts the machine to begin installation, if power management was enabled.
