## 1. Asynchronous Programming

- Alright, before we dive into asyncio library, let's talk about Asynchronous Programming? What is this? Generaly, **Asynchronous programming** is a programming paradigm that does not block.

![](http://blogs.quovantis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Synchronous-vs.-asynchronous.jpg)

- There are some terms you have to understand:

  - [**Asynchronous function call**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_procedure_call): request that a function is called at some time and in some manner, allowing the caller to resume and perform other activities.
  - **Future**: a handle on asynchronous function call allowing the status of the call to be checked and results to be retrieved.
  - **Asynchronous task**: used to refer to the aggregate of an asynchronous function call and resulting future.
  - **Non-blocking I/O**: performing I/O operations via asynchronous requests and responses, rather than waiting for operations to complete.
  - [**Asynchronous I/O**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O): a shorthand that refers to combining asynchronous programming with non-blocking I/O.
  - [**Coroutine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine):

    - Computer program component that generalizes subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed.
    - Or, this is _A function that can be suspended and resumed_.

    ![](https://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/co_return/FunctionsVersusCoroutines.png)

- **Asynchronous programming** is the use of asynchronous techniques, such as issuing asynchronous tasks or function calls.
- Next, let's consider asynchronous programming support in Python: [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html), and [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d2dd7e1b4a76d8b803ac1aa/5fc4d4d7136c7e1ffefdeb9c_3Yj-uX_DZuoCF4QKp_ONfdS_YEbxxc56Ee1sk_XZtreYRBrShwBlTL7LJko0Mm1MB-LiHuTT-ED6P0jx3ku0ZBx8KfeUB3BhWNaDfxDy0CdUA-pmYGlhFoAgQwSm1VHBNp_-8rLK.jpeg)

- When should choose which one? It really depends on the use cases. [Masnun's post](http://masnun.rocks/2016/10/06/async-python-the-different-forms-of-concurrency/) provides us a nice pseudo code:

  ```python
  if io_bound:
      if io_very_slow:
        print("Use Asyncio")
      else:
        print("Use Threads")
  else:
      print("Multi Processing")

  ```

- But this article is about asyncio, right? Let's take a closer look at asyncio.

## 2. What is asyncio?

- Python 3.4 introduced the asyncio library, and Python 3.5 produced the `async/await` expressions to use it palatably.
- asyncio takes a very, very explicit approach to asynchronous programming: only code written in methods flagged as `async` can call any code in an asynchronous way.
- The module provides both a high-level and low-level API.
  - The high-level API is for Python application developers.
  - The low-level API is for library and framework developers.

### 2.1. Coroutine

- A _coroutine_ is a method that can be paused when we have a potentially long-running task and then resumed when that task is finished. In Python, the language implemented first-class support for coroutines and asynchronous programming when the keywords `async` and `await` were explicitly added to the language.
- Coroutine vs Task:
  - A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. [...] Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loop. ([Python 3 docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task))
  - A coroutine can be wrapped in an `asyncio.Task` object and executed independently, as opposed to being executed directly within a coroutine. We will learn more about Task later.
- Coroutine vs Thread:
  - A coroutine is defined as a function.
  - A thread is an object created and managed by the underlying operating system and represented in Python as a `threading.Thread` object.
  - This means that coroutines are typically faster than thread.
  - Coroutine executes within one thread, therefore a single thread may execute many coroutines.
- Coroutine vs Process:
  - Processes, like threads, are created and managed by the underlying operating system and are represented by a `multiprocessing.Process` object.
- Enough talking, show me code:
  - Calling a coroutine does not execute it, but rather returns a coroutine object.
  - How to run it? The answer is using event loop. _Coroutine objects can only run when event loop is running_. Let's move to the next section.

```python
async def custom_coro():
    return 2+2


async def main():
    # await for custom coroutine
    result = await custom_coro()
    print(result)


m = main()
# not executed yet; coro is a coroutine, not 4
print(type(m))

# <class 'coroutine'>
# sys:1: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'main' was never awaited
```

### 2.2. Event loop

- Async code can only run inside an _event loop_. The event loop is the driver code that manages the [cooperative multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking). This is a heart of asyncio, it does many things:
  - Execute coroutines
  - Execute callbacks
  - Preform network i/o
  - Run subprocesses
- Let's run the previous example:

```python
import asyncio


async def custom_coro():
    return 2+2


async def main():
    # await for custom coroutine
    result = await custom_coro()
    print(result)

m = main()

# start the coroutine program
asyncio.run(m)

# 4
```

- `asyncio` module provides functions for accessing and interacting with the event loop - low level.

  - Create/Get a loop:

    - [`asyncio.new_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.new_event_loop): create and return a new event loop object.

    ```python
    import asyncio

    # create and access a new asyncio event loop
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    # report defaults of the loop
    print(loop)

    # <_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=False closed=False debug=False>

    ```

    - [`asyncio.get_running_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_running_loop) (Python >= 3.7): returns the running event loop in the current OS thread. If there is no running event loop a RuntimeError is raised. This function can only be called from a coroutine or a callback.

  - Run a loop:
    - If you want to a long-running loop that keeps responding to events untils it's told to stop, use [`loop.run_forever()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.run_forever)
    - If you want to compute some finite work using coroutines and then stop, use [`loop.run_until_complete(<future or coroutine>)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.run_until_complete).
  - Stop a loop: [`loop.stop()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.stop).
  - Get a loop to call an awaitable: Use [`asyncio.ensure_future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.ensure_future).
  - Run blocking code in another thread: If you need to call some blocking code from a coroutine, and donâ€™t want to block the whole thread, you can make it run in another thread using coroutine [`loop.run_in_executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.run_in_executor)

  ```python
  fn = functools.partial(method, *args)
  result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, fn)
  ```

- For application developers, should typically use the high-levle asyncio functions `asyncio.run()`, and should rarely need to reference the loop object or call its method.
  - `asyncio.run()`: always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once. [Python 3 docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html)

### 2.3. Task

- Tasks provide a handle on independently scheduled and running coroutines and allow the task to be queried, canceled, and results and exceptions to be retrieved later.
  - The _asyncio event loop_ manages _tasks_. As such, all _coroutines_ become and are managed as _tasks_ within the event loop.
  - A Future is a special
- There are 2 main ways to create and schedule a task:

  - Create task with high-level API: [`asyncio.create_task`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task).

  ```python
  # define a coroutine
  async def task_coroutine():
      # ...
  # create a task from a coroutine
  task = async.create_task(task_coroutine())
  ```

  - Create task with low-level API:

    - [`asyncio.ensure_future`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#asyncio.ensure_future)

    ```python
    # create and schedule a task
    task = asyncio.ensure_future(task_coroutine())
    ```

    - [`loop.create_task`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_task):

    ```python
    # get the current event loop
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # create and schedule the task
    task = loop.create_task(task_coroutine())
    ```

- Although we can schedule a coroutine to run independently as a task with the `create_task()` function, it may not run immediately. In fact, the task will not execute until the event loop has an opportunity to run.

```python
import asyncio


async def task_coroutine():
    print('execute the task')
    # wait for a bit
    await asyncio.sleep(2)


async def main():
    print('main coroutine started')
    # create and schedule the task
    task = asyncio.create_task(task_coroutine())
    # wait for the task to complete
    await task
    print('main coroutine done')


# start the asyncio program
asyncio.run(main())

# main coroutine started
# execute the task
# main coroutine done
```

- This is good to know task's life cycle:

  - You can check whether task is done or is canceled (`done()`, `canceled()`).
  - To get its result, use `result()`.
  - To get its exception, use `exception()`.

  ![](https://superfastpython.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Asyncio-Task-Life-Cycle.png)

- One more thing, we can add a done callback to a task via `add_done_callback()`. This method tasks the name of a function call when the task is done.

```python
import asyncio


def callback(task):
    print('this is a callback of', task)


async def task_coroutine():
    print('execute the task')
    # wait for a bit
    await asyncio.sleep(2)


async def main():
    print('main coroutine started')
    # create and schedule the task
    task = asyncio.create_task(task_coroutine())
    task.add_done_callback(callback)
    # wait for the task to complete
    await task
    print('main coroutine done')


# start the asyncio program
asyncio.run(main())

# main coroutine started
# execute the task
# this is a callback of <Task finished name='Task-2' coro=<task_coroutine() done, defined at /.../run_task_callback.py:8> result=None>
# main coroutine done
```

- Create many tasks:

```python
import asyncio


async def task_coroutine(index):
    print(f'task {index} is running')
    await asyncio.sleep(2)


async def main():
    print('main coroutine started')
    # start many tasks
    started_tasks = [asyncio.create_task(task_coroutine(i)) for i in range(10)]
    # allow some of the tasks time to start
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    # get all tasks
    tasks = asyncio.all_tasks()

    for task in tasks:
        print(f'> {task.get_name()}, {task.get_coro()}')

    for task in started_tasks:
        await task

asyncio.run(main())

# main coroutine started
# task 0 is running
# task 1 is running
# task 2 is running
# task 3 is running
# task 4 is running
# task 5 is running
# task 6 is running
# task 7 is running
# task 8 is running
# task 9 is running
# > Task-3, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab1016e30>
# > Task-6, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea4c10>
# > Task-11, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea4e40>
# > Task-2, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab1016ce0>
# > Task-9, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea4d60>
# > Task-4, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab10175a0>
# > Task-7, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea4c80>
# > Task-5, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea49e0>
# > Task-10, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea4dd0>
# > Task-8, <coroutine object task_coroutine at 0x7fbab0ea4cf0>
# > Task-1, <coroutine object main at 0x7fbab1016650>
```

## 3. Play with asyncio

We will go through some common usage.

### 3.1. asyncio.gather()

- [`asyncio.gather()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.gather): allows the caller to group multiple awaitables together.
  - Call `gather()` with:
    - Multiple tasks
    - Multiple coroutines
    - Mixture of tasks and coroutines
  - It returns an `asyncio.Future` object that represents the group of awaitables.
- Run many coroutines:

  - Allow a program to prepare the tasks that are to be executed concurrently and then trigger their execution all at once and wait for them to complete.

  ```python
  import asyncio


  async def task_coroutine(index):
      print(f'> task {index} executing')
      await asyncio.sleep(2)


  async def main():
      print('main coroutine started')
      group_coros = [task_coroutine(i) for i in range(10)]
      await asyncio.gather(*group_coros)
      print('main done')

  asyncio.run(main())

  # main coroutine started
  # > task 0 executing
  # > task 1 executing
  # > task 2 executing
  # > task 3 executing
  # > task 4 executing
  # > task 5 executing
  # > task 6 executing
  # > task 7 executing
  # > task 8 executing
  # > task 9 executing
  # main done
  ```
