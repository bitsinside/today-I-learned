# Introducing variable fonts

[Variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/variable_fonts) - officially known as OpenType Font Variations - remove the explicit distinctions between different weights and styles, which have existed since the early days of typesetting.

With variable fonts, the choice of exactly how heavy or slanted or wide (or any other parameter) type should be is placed into the hands of the user, rather than having those decided for us by the type designer. Traditionally, all possible weights and styles have been separated out into different font files, whereas variable fonts combine all of those variations into one. Because of this, overall file size is greatly reduced compared to loading multiple individual font files—and that’s a key consideration for web typography.

The simplest way to think of variable fonts is to imagine a slider (actually called an axis), ), with the lightest weight (usually called something like Thin or ExtraLight) at one end, regular in the middle, and the heaviest weight (usually called something like ExtraBold or Black) at the other. Where traditionally we’ve had to choose weights from specific points on that scale—determined by the type designer during font production—we can now choose any point on the scale.

By the way, it’s important to note that familiar style names—light, regular, bold, etc. for weight, or condensed, normal, wide etc. for width—still appear in font menus when variable font families are installed. They’re referred to technically as “named instances.” So, using variable fonts doesn’t mean waving goodbye to the labels and conveniently-shared styles that we’ve been used to.
