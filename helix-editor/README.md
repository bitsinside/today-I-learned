- Features:
  - Vim-like modal editing
  - Multiple selections

  - Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter
- First impression:
  - Fast.
  - If you're familiar with Vim/Neovim, it is very easy to use.
  - Built-in language server support is good.
  - Simple configuration: you can just use it without any configuration, it looks good out of the box. Otherwise, if you want to tweak, follow [this](https://docs.helix-editor.com/configuration.html).
