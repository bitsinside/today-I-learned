Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event - either experiencing it or witnessing it.

## Symptoms

- Symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event.
- PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into 4 types:
  - Intrusive memories:
    - Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event
    - Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)
    - Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event
    - Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event
  - Avoidance:
    - Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event
    - Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event
  - Negative changes in thinking and mood:
    - Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world
    - Hopelessness about the future
    - Memory probolems
    - Difficulty maintaining close relationships
    - Feeling detached from family and friends
    - Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed
    - Feeling emotionally numb
  - Changes in physical and emotional reactions:
    - Being easily startled or frightened
    - Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast
    - Trouble sleeping, concentrating
    - Always being on guard for danger
    - Overwhelming guilt or shame
    - Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior
- Intensity of symptoms:
  - PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time.
- When to see a doctor: If you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, if they're severe, or if you feel you're having trouble getting your life back under control, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.

## Causes

- PTSD is probably caused by a complex mix of:
  - Stressful experiences, including the amount and severity of trauma you've gone through in your life
  - Inherited mental health risks, such as a family history of anxiety and depression
  - Inherited features of your personality â€” often called your temperament
  - The way your brain regulates the chemicals and hormones your body releases in response to stressful

## Risk factors

- Experiencing intense or long-lasting trauma
- Having experienced other trauma earlier in life, such as childhood abuse
- Having a job that increases your risk of being exposed to traumatic events, such as military personnel and first responders
- Having other mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression
- Having problems with substance misuse, such as excess drinking or drug use
- Lacking a good support system of family and friends
- Having blood relatives with mental health problems, including anxiety or depression

## Prevention

- Getting timely help and support may prevent normal stress reactions from getting worse and developing into PTSD.
- Support from others also may help prevent you from turning to unhealthy coping methods, such as misuse of alcohol or drugs.
