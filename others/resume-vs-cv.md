# Resume vs. Curriculum Vitae

The primary differences between a resum and curriculum vitae are length, what is included, and what each is used for. While both are used in job applications, a resume and a CV are not always interchangeable.

- Most resumes are **competeency-based**. They are personal marketing documents intended to showcase the candicate's skills, notable achievements, and work experience to the greatest advantage.
- Curriculum vitae, submitted for jobs in academia, scientific research, and medical fields, are **credential-based**, providing a comprehensive (often lengthly) listing of one's education, certification, research experience, and professional affiliations and memberships.
