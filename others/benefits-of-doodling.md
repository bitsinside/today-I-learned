# The "thinking" benefits of doodling

Have you ever found yourself listening to something really boring, then wafting off into your own mind, your hand scribbling random things on a piece of paper in front of you? Whether it's a conference call or a tedious lecture, being all ears can be a challenge when your hands want to be a part of the moment. Nobody is immune to this either. Even American presidents have found themselves sketching away: 26 of 44 American Presidents doodled, from Theodore Roosevelt, who doodled animals and children, to Ronald Reagan, who doodled cowboys and football players, and John F. Kennedy, who doodled dominoes. Traditionally, we have thought of these doodles as a sign of distraction â€” an indication that your mind was not where it was supposed to be. Yet, recent research has shown that doodling is not an enemy of attention; it may in fact be a friend.

- Doodling and memory:
  - When you're bored, your fight-or-flight system will do all that it can to rally and stay alert. Doodling (a form of [fidgeting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776418/)) may be a last-ditch attempt at staying awake and attentive. Doodling keeps you from falling asleep, or simply staring blankly when your brain has already turned off. The permission to "free-draw" keeps your brain online just a little while longer.
  - In addition, paying continuous attention places a [strain on the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10748642), and doodling may be just the break your brain needs to keep attending without losing total interest.
- Doodling for stress relief and improved focus:
  - Spontaneous drawings may also [relieve psychological distress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2076785/?page=1), making it easier to attend to things.
