# Microsoft Office formats and metadata

- Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE [Compound File Binary Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format).
  - At its simplest, the Compound File Binary Format is a container, with little restriction on what can be stored within it.
  - This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform.
- Starting with Office 2007, the default file format has been a version of [Office Open XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML), though different from the one standardized and published by Ecma International and by ISO/IEC.
  - Office Open XML (also informally known as OOXML) is a zipped, XML-based file format developed by Microsoft for representing spreadsheets, charts, presentations and word processing documents. Ecma International standardized the initial version as ECMA-376. ISO and IEC standardized later versions as ISO/IEC 29500.
  - Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000, and Office 2004 for Mac OS X.
