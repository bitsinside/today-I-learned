# Corner Note-taking Method

Source: <https://thinkinsights.net/consulting/cornell-method-great-notes/>

The Cornel Method is a system for taking, organizing and reviewing notes. Professor [Water Pauk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pauk) of Cornell University devised this method in the 1950s. The strategy involves learners dividing their paper into two columns with a row across the bottom. Furthermore, it requires very little preparation which makes it ideal for note taking in a classroom or during a client meeting.

Page layout:

- At the top of the page you write down _the name of the course, meeting or seminar_ together with the date and the subject.
- The left portion should be around 7 cm wide and is called the _Cue/Questions/Keywords_ column. This is where you'll put your subheadings, all of which should be written as questions.
- In the larger column on the right, also called the _note-taking_ column, writes your notes in the usual manner.
- Keep the bottom of each page as a _summary or conclusion_. Summarizing the notes in the bottom row helps to consolidate your understanding. This is best done after the class or workshop. This also helps identify gaps where further study or analysis is required.
