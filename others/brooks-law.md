# Brooks's law

Brooks's law is an observation about software project management that _"Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"_. It coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book the _The Mythical Man-Month_. According to Brooks, under certain conditions, an incremental person when added to a project makes it take more, not less time.

- It takes some time for the people added to a project become productive - "ramp up" time.
- Communication overhead increases as the number of people increases.
- Adding more people to a highly divisible task, such as cleaning rooms in a htoel, decrease the overall task duration (up to the point where additional workers get in each other's way). However, other tasks including many specialties in software projects are less divisible; Brooks points out this limited divisibility with another example: while it takes one woman nine months to make one baby, "nine women can't make a baby in one month".
