## 1. Introduction

- PKM is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share Knowledge in their daily activities ([Grundspenkis 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFGrundspenkis2007)) and the way in which these processes support work activities ([Wright 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFWright2005))
- The definition of personal knowledge management (PKM), simply put, is to have **a structured system in place to organize your thoughts, notes, and files**.
- What else is PKM called?
  - Digital file management
  - Digital note taking systems
  - Information management systems
  - Knowledge management (KM)
  - Knowledge management systems
  - Note taking systems
  - Note taking workflow
  - Personal information management (PIM)
  - Personal management systems

## 2. Tools & systems

Personal knowledge management systems can range from simple to complex.

- Paper-based personal knowledge management system, such as a [paper-based Zettelkasten system on index cards](https://herbertlui.net/8-lessons-from-800-note-cards-in-the-zettelkasten/).
- [Notion](http://www.notion.so/)
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
- [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian.md/): Obsidian backlinks allow _bi-directional linking_. This means that if page A links to page B, Obsidian also knows that page B is linking back to page A. This allows ideas to start linking together as you write new notes which creates a knowledge graph of linked notes
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).
- [SiYuan](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan): SiYuan is a privacy-first personal knowledge management system, support fine-grained block-level reference and Markdown WYSIWYG.

### 3.1. Building a second brain (BASB) & PARA

- The concept of [building a second brain (BASB)] was created by Tigao Forte of Forte Labs. This structure grew out of his [PARA folder system](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) for organizing digital content. Forte was originally a productivity training consultant for software companies, and developed this particular structure for organizing reference works in parallel to organizing tasks and projects.
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/about), a talented UX designer, anthropologist, and artist, created a beautifully illustrated infographic of the building a second brain (BASB) and PARA methodology, linked here: <https://maggieappleton.com/basb>

### 3.2. Digital mind gardens

- The concept of a [digital mind garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) reflects the reality that our personal knowledge is meant to always be growing, adapting, and changing. A digital mind garden might be right for you if you are working on learning a subject or writing a project that has many interconnected ideas, and youâ€™re not yet clear on how some of those ideas may interact with each other. A digital mind garden can be a useful tool for structuring and connecting ideas you may not otherwise have linked together.

## 4. My attempts

- I use GitHub repository to manage my personal knowledge. At the beginning, I'm totally satisfied. I'm familiar with Markdown and Git, I manage and store literally everything (note, knowledge, source, picture, ...) in GitHub.
- // WIP - too lazy
- Note that I'm trying Logseq now.
